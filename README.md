## Assignment 6

In our Gitlab repository, there are three main folders which are companyX, companyY, and companyZ. We decided that each company works inside their own folder which result in one master branch. From this approach, we do not have to worry about merge conflict as we can work parallel and separately.

## Each company endpoint
**Company X**: https://a6-companyx.azurewebsites.net/
**Company Y**: http://companyy-env.eba-2uu3usha.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
**Company Z**: https://companyz.azurewebsites.net/
